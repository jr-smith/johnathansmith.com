I have found podcasts are a great way to keep up to date with a lot of 
the latest information. I've compiled a list of a few I really like.


## [Command Line Heroes](https://www.redhat.com/en/command-line-heroes)

Recently discovered and probably my _favorite_ podcast. It's like a really well done NPR piece, but about
computers and technology, including both their history and their future. 
Extraordinarily well-done with great writing and interviews. While not Laravel
specific, you *must* give it a listen.

## [Laravel Snippet](https://player.fm/series/the-laravel-snippet)

This is the podcast from Taylor Otwell, the creator of Laravel. He usually 
talks about the latest changes to the framework.

## [Laracasts Snippet](https://laracasts.simplecast.fm/)

Laracasts Snippet is from Jeffrey Way. He's the guy behind Laracasts. He
speaks about Laravel as well as a host of other topics.

## [Full Stack Radio](http://www.fullstackradio.com/)

Adam Wathan, of the Laravel community, interviews web and software
developers of all sorts. He dives into a bunch of different topics, and it's 
certainly worth th elisten.

## [JS Party](https://changelog.com/jsparty)

A bunch of devs talking about JavaScript... pretty awesome!
