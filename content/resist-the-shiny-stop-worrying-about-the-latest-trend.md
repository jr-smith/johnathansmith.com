We see it all the time, the coolest, shiniest programming language, framework, tool, GUI, font, color scheme, etc. I'm going to tell you something that few seem to realize...

### It probably doesn't matter!

Now, we should be kept abreast of the latest tech, but most of this is passing and fading. Just think, had you started with C back in the 70s, you would still be programming in it and loving it just fine! However, now we \[insert infinite number here]. I used to be on twitter all the time, trying to find the latest and greatest, but eventually realized it was fruitless for a few reasons.

#### Early adoption is riddled with bugs.

Most brand new projects have a *ton* of bugs. Let other people worry about this, don't be stymied time and time again. Most early projects have little documentation too. Don't waste your time on that.

#### If it's noteworthy, it will be there tomorrow.

If it's a great tool, you bet people will start using it. 

#### It could be abandoned in a week.

Is it some cool new package? Who's the author? Will they maintain it for the next decade? Year? Month? 

#### It won't make you any money.

This may seem like an odd point, but as a developer I like getting a good salary. A brand new tool won't be used by anybody, except maybe you and a handful of others. More than likely, you won't be able to bring it to the table at a new job.

#### So, in summary:

1. Stick to the tried and true. 
2. Stick to languages that are mature and provide good salaries with 
a lot of employment opportunities.
3. Don't fret about IDE, color schemes, fonts, and other trivially matters, because,
these do not, in fact, matter.
